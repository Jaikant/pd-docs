# Add a Phone Number
**Estimated Time: 4 minutes**

We need to add your business phone number in the Meta console to connect it with your WhatsApp Business account. Once added, Meta generates a unique Phone Number ID. You'll use this ID in the Predictable Dialogs app to enable sending and receiving messages through WhatsApp Cloud API.

Below are the steps to add your phone number:


## Access Your App Settings

- Choose **API Setup** from the dropdown options.

## Add Your Phone Number
- Under the **Send and Receive Messages** section, find the phone number dropdown.
- Click **+ Add phone number** to insert your new number.

## Copy Your Phone Number ID
- Once the number is added, ensure to copy the “Phone Number ID” associated with the newly added phone number. You’ll need this ID for API calls.
