# Theme

You can customize your chatbot agent’s greeting, colors, images, inputs, and borders using our live theming playground on the theme page. You can also add your own custom CSS and instantly preview how your chatbot agent will look.

The Theme page in the Predictable Dialogs app lets you control all visual aspects of your web widget, including:

- [Greeting Message](/docs/channels/web/theme/greeting-message)
- [Background](/docs/channels/web/theme/background)
- [Font](/docs/channels/web/theme/font)
- [Avatars](/docs/channels/web/theme/avatars)
- [Bubble](/docs/channels/web/theme/bubble)
- [Input Styling](/docs/channels/web/theme/input-styling)
- [Theme Templates & Custom CSS](/docs/channels/web/theme/theme-templates)

For more advanced CSS-based customization, also see the dedicated [Custom CSS](/docs/channels/web/custom-css) page.

## Go to page which themes the widget
- Sign in to [Predictable Dialogs](https://predictabledialogs.com/sign-in). Click your existing agent. Click "Theme" on side bar.
