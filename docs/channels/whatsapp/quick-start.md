## Go to page which installs agents
- Click "Install" on menu.

## Add WhatsApp to Agent
### Select platform 
- Click on **Platform** tab and select WhatsApp. 

### Add your WA business to PD
To complete this step you would need your **WhatsApp token** & **Phone Number Id**. You can get this by following the instructions in [WhatsApp Business Setup](https://predictabledialogs.com/docs/category/whatsapp-business-setup) 
- Click on WhatsApp Business
- Click button **ADD TO WHATSAPP**
  - Enter your *WhatsApp Token* and click **Next**
  - Enter your WhatsApp *Phone Number Id* and click **Next**
  
### Add the webhook to WhatsApp
- The next step, is to add the webhook and token to meta.
  - On the modal, click on the link **"Meta Console"**, this will open the page on which you can enter the webhook and token provided. 
  - On the meta page click **Verify and save** to save the webhook and token.
  - Scroll down on the meta page and locate the field with the name **"messages"**, click the toggle button so it is **"Subscribed"**.


Now, send a message to your WhatsApp Business Phone Number configured and you should get a reply from the PD agent! (Sometimes it takes a few hours for Meta to
verify your details)


### Customize the initial response
Select *Greeting* tab and enter or generate your greeting.

The initial response is the first message your AI agent displays. Personalize it to set the tone for user interactions.

- **Enable or Disable:**  
  Go to the **Greeting** tab and use the toggle button to turn the initial response on or off.
  :::tip initial response using a prompt
  If you turn off the greeting, you can generate an greeting/initial response using your own prompt. This is [configured](http://predictabledialogs.com/docs/channels/web/widgets/bubble#widget-behaviour--styling-parameters-optional) using the `initialPrompt` prop on the widget.

| **Bold**             | `*text*`                                 |  **Hello**             |
| *Italic*             | `_text_`                                 |  *Hello*               |
| ~~Strikethrough~~    | `~text~`                                 |  ~~Hello~~             |
