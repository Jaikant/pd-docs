# Functions for OpenAI Resources

Function calling capabilities for OpenAI resources are currently in development and will be available soon.

## What's Coming

OpenAI resources will support:
- **Custom Functions**: Define your own function schemas
- **API Integrations**: Connect to external services and databases  
- **Dynamic Responses**: Generate responses based on real-time data
- **Tool Management**: Easy function configuration through the Predictable Dialogs interface

## Current Status

Functions are **not yet available** for OpenAI resources. In the Tools section of your OpenAI resource, you'll see:

```
Functions: Coming Soon
```

## Alternative: OpenAI Assistant

If you need function calling capabilities right now, consider using an **OpenAI Assistant** resource instead:

- Functions are fully supported for OpenAI Assistant resources
- Configure functions on the OpenAI platform  
- Import and manage them through Predictable Dialogs
- See the [OpenAI Assistant Function Calling](/docs/providers/openai-assistant/function-calling) guide

## Stay Updated

We'll update this documentation once function calling for OpenAI resources becomes available. The interface will be similar to the OpenAI Assistant implementation but optimized for the faster OpenAI resource architecture.
