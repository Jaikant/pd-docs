# File Search & RAG

**Estimated Time: 4 minutes**

File Search, also known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enables your AI agents to find and reference information from uploaded documents. This allows your agents to provide accurate, context-specific answers based on your own content.

## How File Search Works

1. **Document Processing** - Your files are broken into smaller chunks and converted to vector embeddings
2. **Vector Storage** - These embeddings are stored in a searchable vector database
3. **Semantic Search** - When users ask questions, the system finds relevant chunks using semantic similarity
4. **Response Generation** - The AI incorporates the retrieved information into its response

## Primary Use Cases

### Knowledge Base Queries
Turn your documentation into an intelligent help system.

**Examples:**
- Company policies and procedures
- Product documentation and FAQs
- Training materials and guides
- Technical specifications

### Document Analysis
Extract insights from large document collections.

**Examples:**
- Research paper analysis
- Legal document review
- Financial report summaries
- Medical record insights

### Contextual Support
Provide personalized assistance based on specific content.

**Examples:**
- Customer-specific troubleshooting guides
- Personalized onboarding materials
- Role-specific documentation
- Project-related information

## Supported File Types

Common formats supported across providers:
- **PDF** - Reports, manuals, academic papers
- **Text** - Plain text files, documentation
- **Word Documents** - DOCX files with rich formatting
- **Markdown** - Technical documentation, README files

*Note: Specific supported formats may vary by provider*

## Key Concepts

### Vector Embeddings
Mathematical representations of text that capture semantic meaning, allowing the system to find conceptually similar content even when exact keywords don't match.

### Chunks and Chunking
Documents are split into smaller pieces (chunks) to improve search relevance and manage token limits.

**Chunk Size Considerations:**
- **Smaller chunks** (400-600 tokens) - More precise, specific information
- **Larger chunks** (800-1200 tokens) - Better context and relationships

### Chunk Overlap
Overlapping text between chunks ensures important context isn't lost at chunk boundaries.

**Overlap Benefits:**
- Maintains context across chunk boundaries
- Reduces information fragmentation
- Improves search result relevance

## Document Preparation Best Practices

### Structure Your Content
- Use clear headings and sections
- Include relevant keywords naturally
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Remove unnecessary formatting artifacts

### Optimize for Search
- Write descriptive section titles
- Include summary paragraphs
- Use bullet points for key information
- Avoid excessive technical jargon without context

### Content Organization
- Group related information together
- Avoid duplicate content across files
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include context for acronyms and abbreviations

## Performance Optimization

### Chunk Configuration
Start with default settings and adjust based on your content:

- **Technical Documentation**: 800-1200 token chunks with 400-500 token overlap
- **FAQ Content**: 400-600 token chunks with 200-300 token overlap  
- **Long-form Content**: 1000-1500 token chunks with 500-600 token overlap

### Search Result Tuning

**Maximum Chunks Returned:**
- **1-3 chunks** - Very focused responses, faster processing
- **5-7 chunks** - Balanced relevance and context
- **10+ chunks** - Comprehensive context, higher token usage

### Cost Considerations
- More chunks returned = higher token usage per query
- Larger chunk sizes = more tokens per search result
- Monitor usage patterns and adjust accordingly

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Your Knowledge Base
1. **Coverage Testing** - Ask questions about different sections of your content
2. **Edge Case Testing** - Try queries that span multiple documents
3. **Accuracy Verification** - Ensure responses match source material
4. **Relevance Testing** - Check that returned chunks are actually relevant

### Monitoring Performance
- Review search result quality in session logs
- Track user satisfaction with document-based answers
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Identify gaps in your knowledge base coverage

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Poor Search Results
**Problem**: Irrelevant or incomplete answers
**Solutions**: 
- Improve document structure and headings
- Adjust chunk size and overlap settings
- Add more comprehensive content
- Include FAQ-style content for common queries

### Information Gaps
**Problem**: Agent can't find information that exists in documents
**Solutions**:
- Check document processing status
- Verify content is properly structured
- Add alternative phrasings for key concepts
- Ensure technical terms are defined in context

### Inconsistent Responses
**Problem**: Different answers to similar questions
**Solutions**:
- Standardize terminology across documents
- Remove or consolidate duplicate content
- Create comprehensive, authoritative sources
- Use consistent formatting and structure

## Provider-Specific Implementation

### OpenAI
File search is fully available with Predictable Dialogs managing the vector stores.

**Features:**

## Advanced Strategies

### Hybrid Approaches
Combine file search with function calling for comprehensive solutions:

1. **Search Internal Docs** - Find relevant internal information
2. **Call External APIs** - Fetch real-time or personalized data
3. **Synthesize Response** - Combine both sources for complete answers

### Content Versioning
Manage evolving documentation:
- Update vector stores when documents change
- Version control your knowledge base files
- Test changes before deploying to production
- Maintain backup copies of vector stores

### Multi-Language Support
Handle documents in different languages:
- Group documents by language
- Use language-specific vector stores
- Consider translation for key documents
- Test search quality across languages
