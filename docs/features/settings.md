## Settings
The settings page allows you to customize your Predictable Dialogs AI agents with ease. Configure initial responses, manage topic buttons, and generate engaging content using OpenAI. Follow the steps below to optimize your AI agent’s functionality to enhance user interactions on your website.

## Go to agent settings page
- Sign in to [Predictable Dialogs](https://predictabledialogs.com/sign-in). 
- Select your existing agent. 
- Click **Settings** on menu.

## Customize the initial response
The initial response is the first message your AI agent displays. Personalize it to set the tone for user interactions.

- **Enable or Disable:**  
  Go to the **Initial Response** tab and use the toggle button to turn the initial response on or off.

- **Add a Custom Response:**  
  Enter your desired message in the input area. Use markdown for styling, such as:

```
**Hi there**
```
Basic HTML compatible with markdown is also supported:

```
<strong> **Hi there** </strong>
```

- **Generate Responses with OpenAI:**  
Click the ✨ button to create an initial response using your OpenAI assistant and a custom prompt.

*Note:* Links in this markdown viewer will open in the same tab, as the 'open in new tab' feature is not currently supported.
