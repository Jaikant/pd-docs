In the Predictable Dialogs app, youâ€™ll see two main pages:

1. **Agents** (the default page when the app opens)  
2. **AI Resources** (can be opened from the menu)

## Agents

An **Agent** is the entity you list and create from the Agents page. It uses the configured AI Resources to perform tasks. 

We currently provide Chatbot Agents. Chatbot Agents can be added to websites or connected to WhatsApp. 

You can give each Chatbot Agent its own AI Resource, theme and settings.

## AI Resources

An **AI Resource** is an AI model with attached tools. Every AI resource needs:

- A **unique name** within the app.
- An **API key** to the external provider.

:::tip
You can connect the same AI Resource to multiple chatbot agents. Each agent functioning independently using its own theme, sessions and reports.

:::tip
You can update a chatbot agent to a different AI Resource at any time.
