# Implementation Plan: Adding Programmatic Chat Reset Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for documenting the `window.Agent.reset()` functionality that has been implemented to programmatically reset chat sessions across all widget types (Standard, Popup, and Bubble).

## Feature Specification Summary
The reset command works programmatically clearing all session data and reinitializing the chatbot for a fresh conversation. Works across Standard, Popup, and Bubble widgets. Available as `window.Agent.reset()` following existing command patterns.

## Files Modified

  - Usage example with HTML button
  - Explanation that reset works across all widget types

### 2. `/docs/channels/web/widgets/popup.md`
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Change**: Added `Agent.reset()` method to existing "Programmatic Control" section
- **Location**: Updated method table (line 80) and examples (line 88)
- **Content Added**:
  - `Agent.reset()` method in methods table
  - Reset button in HTML examples

### 3. `/docs/channels/web/widgets/bubble.md`
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

- **Location**: Updated method table (line 194) and examples (line 204)
- **Content Added**:
  - `Agent.reset()` method in methods table (positioned before preview message methods)
  - Reset button in HTML examples

### 4. `/docs/features/sessions.md`
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Change**: Updated existing reset button mention to include programmatic method
- **Location**: Updated line 9 and added new section after line 10
- **Content Added**:
  - Updated main description to include programmatic reset
  - New "Resetting Sessions" subsection explaining both UI and programmatic methods
  - Clear explanation of functionality across all widget types

## Implementation Details Completed

### Consistent Documentation Pattern
- All widget documentation now includes `Agent.reset()` in their programmatic control sections
- Consistent method description: "Clears all session data and reinitializes the chatbot for a fresh conversation"
- HTML examples include reset button alongside existing control examples
- Documentation follows existing formatting and style conventions

### Cross-Widget Compatibility
- Documented that reset functionality works across Standard, Popup, and Bubble widgets
- Maintained consistency with existing `Agent.open()`, `Agent.close()`, and `Agent.toggle()` patterns
- Preserved all existing functionality documentation

### Session Management Integration
- Enhanced sessions documentation to explain both UI and programmatic reset methods
- Clear explanation of what reset does (clears session data and reinitializes chatbot)
- Maintained existing content about session counting behavior

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Method follows existing `window.Agent.*` pattern established by other programmatic controls
- Reset functionality clears all session data completely
- Works consistently across all three widget types
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Documentation Standards Followed
- Maintained existing markdown formatting and structure
- Used consistent method documentation format across all widgets
- Included practical JavaScript examples
- Preserved existing code style and conventions
- Added functionality without disrupting current content structure

## Testing Considerations
The documentation assumes the functionality has been implemented and tested. The documentation should be verified against the actual implementation to ensure:
- Method name accuracy (`window.Agent.reset()`)
- Functionality description accuracy (clears session data and reinitializes)
- Cross-widget compatibility as documented

## Completion Status
All planned documentation updates have been implemented successfully:
- ✅ Standard widget documentation updated
- ✅ Popup widget documentation updated  
- ✅ Bubble widget documentation updated
- ✅ Sessions documentation enhanced
- ✅ Implementation plan documented

The reset functionality is now fully documented across all relevant documentation sections with consistent messaging and examples.
