# Tools Section Documentation Implementation Plan

## Analysis Summary

After analyzing the current documentation structure, I found that tool-related information is scattered across provider-specific sections:

- **Function calling** is documented in `docs/providers/openai-assistant/function-calling.md`
- **File search/RAG** is documented in `docs/providers/openai/file-search.md` 
- **Future functions** are mentioned in `docs/providers/openai/functions.md`

This makes it difficult for users to understand the platform's tool capabilities without diving into provider-specific documentation.

## Implementation Plan

### Files to be Added/Modified/Deleted

**Added:**
- `docs/tools/_category_.json` - Category configuration for tools section
- `docs/tools/overview.md` - General overview of tools and capabilities
- `docs/tools/function-calling.md` - Provider-agnostic function calling guide
- `docs/tools/file-search.md` - Provider-agnostic file search guide

**Modified:**
- `sidebars.js` - Add tools section to navigation
- `docs/providers/openai-assistant/function-calling.md` - Update to focus on OpenAI Assistant specifics and link to generic guide
- `docs/providers/openai/file-search.md` - Update to focus on OpenAI specifics and link to generic guide
- `docs/providers/openai/functions.md` - Update with link to generic tools overview

**Deleted:**
- None

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Create Tools Category (`docs/tools/_category_.json`)
```json
{
  "label": "Tools",
  "position": 4,
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index",
    "description": "AI tool capabilities for enhancing your agents with external data and actions."
  }
}
```

### 2. Tools Overview (`docs/tools/overview.md`)
- Explain what tools are in the context of AI agents
- List available tool types (Function Calling, File Search/RAG)
- Explain benefits and use cases for each tool type
- Provider compatibility matrix
- Links to specific implementation guides

### 3. Generic Function Calling Guide (`docs/tools/function-calling.md`)
- General concepts and use cases (moved from current OpenAI Assistant doc)
- How function calling works across providers
- Best practices for endpoint design
- Authentication patterns
- Provider-specific implementation links

### 4. Generic File Search Guide (`docs/tools/file-search.md`)
- RAG/Vector search concepts
- When to use file search vs function calling
- Document preparation best practices
- Performance considerations
- Provider-specific implementation links

### 5. Update Navigation (`sidebars.js`)
Add tools section between Features and API Reference:
```javascript
{
  type: 'category',
  label: 'Tools',
  link: {
    type: 'generated-index',
    description: 'AI tool capabilities for enhancing your agents.',
  },
  items: [
    'tools/overview',
    'tools/function-calling',
    'tools/file-search',
  ],
}
```

### 6. Update Provider-Specific Documentation
- Refactor existing docs to focus on provider-specific implementation details
- Add prominent links to generic tools documentation
- Remove redundant general explanations
- Maintain step-by-step configuration instructions

## Information Architecture Benefits

1. **Discoverability**: Users can quickly find all available tools in one section
2. **Provider Agnostic Learning**: Users understand concepts before diving into specific implementations  
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Common concepts explained once, referenced everywhere
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Overview → Generic Guide → Provider-specific Implementation
5. **Future Scalability**: Easy to add new tool types or providers

## User Journey Improvement

**Before**: User must know about specific providers to discover tool capabilities
**After**: User discovers tools first, then chooses appropriate provider for their needs

This restructure makes the documentation more intuitive for new users while maintaining detailed implementation guidance for experienced users.
